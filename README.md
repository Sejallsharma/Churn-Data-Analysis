# Churn-Data-Analysis
The project included the following highlights:
1. Finding out how many customers use which payment method.
2. Analysing customers on the basis of Contract i.e Month to Month, one year, two year contract.
3. Understanding how many of them use paperless billing methods.
4. And ultimately, finding out how many customers have stopped using the services of that hypothetical company.
